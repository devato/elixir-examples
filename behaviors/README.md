# Elixir Behaviors

Explicit contracts are known as “behaviours” in Elixir.

This simple app demonstrates how to define a behavior / contract / API for
parsing local configuration files in different formats. (json, yaml)

## Notes:
- There are 2 local config files in json and yaml.
- Uses behavior to define the contract for local file parsers.
